## MOTD

The following is a suggested `motd.txt`:
```markdown
# Need to know

Server autokicks for:

* Chat
* Friendly Fire(FF)
* Exposure to FF
* Vote

Thanks for playing!

# Reconnect

If kicked, you may reconnect via console:

    connect [the.dedicated.server.ip]

# NOT A MOD

It's a VAC server and you will be awarded any achievement in the game.
See L4D2-Observer:

    https://github.com/carlosjhr64/l4d2-observer

# Rankings and tallies

Rankings and FF tallies are eventfully displayed as:

    FirstPLayer-FF-Exposure-Pardons ... LastPlayer-FF-Exposure-Pardons

Every FF will demote you down to last place at which point you'll be kicked.
You'll also be kicked for excessive FF(>3) and exposure(>3).

After having played at least 3 minutes, pardons are granted for:

* Pity after team death, 1 if player has none, up to 3 times
* Level completion, +1, up to 3 max

Tallies are re-balanced by a par minimum when a new player joins the game, and
by a par middle when a level is completed.

# Other kicks

* There is no tolerance for chat, not even with pardons
* After 3 kicks, a player(troll) will be kicked on any FF or exposure
* On a vote call, last player will be kicked unless played at least 3 minutes
* Unless in expert mode, last player gets kicked every 3 minutes
* A vote to kick will also kick the last player

The server is meant to be played for an entire uninterrupted campaign in expert
mode. The vote suppression is meant to stop server hijacking.

# Admin

If the game's admin leaves or is kicked,
the longest playing player is assigned as the new admin.
The sole job is to kick idle trolls.
The idle kick command must be entered exactly or
the admin will get kicked for chat!
To kick player number 1, 2, 3, or 4 respectively:

* `say !idle1`
* `say !idle2`
* `say !idle3`
* `say !idle4`
```
